This is a translation of the keccak reference implementation by keccak.team into Verilog using ghdl and yosys. The original VDHL reference implementations are available at the keccak standard website: https://keccak.team/files/KeccakVHDL-3.1.zip

To set up GHDL and yosys, I recommend the docker image developed by JKU: https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS
